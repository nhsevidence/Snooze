A RESTful Framework for ASP.NET MVC originaly developed by http://github.com/andrewdavey

ASP.NET MVC is far too reliant on magic-strings. Snooze is a thin layer on top of the ASP.NET MVC framework that brings some sanity back!
Snooze makes URLs a first-class, strongly-typed concept. Controllers contain methods that handle HTTP requests for URLs.

Snooze is still under development, but the following samples are from working code.

Enjoy!
